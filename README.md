## A Project by [Gaurab Kundu](https://linkedin.com/in/gaurab-kundu) 

### Overview:

The project aims to analyze and derive insights from Covid-19 data encompassing cases, deaths, and vaccination statistics on a global scale.

### Goals:

- Analyze the progression of Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations worldwide.
- Explore the relationship between infection rates, death rates, and vaccination rates.
- Identify countries heavily affected by the pandemic and those with successful vaccination drives.

### Tools and Skills Used:
- SQL: Joins, CTE's (Common Table Expressions), Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.

- Data exploration, analysis, and visualization

- Tableau: To visualize Global Numbers, Percentage of Population Infected per Country, Total Deaths per Continent, Percentage of Population infected over time in countries Brazil, China, India, Italy, Russia.

### Data Sources:

- CovidDeaths Table: Contains information about Covid-19 deaths worldwide, including location, date, total cases, total deaths, and population.
- CovidVaccinations Table: Stores data about Covid-19 vaccinations, including location, date, new vaccinations, and population.

### Queries and Analysis:

#### CovidDeaths Exploration:

- Initial exploration of essential data fields from the CovidDeaths table.
- Analysis of death percentages concerning total cases in a specific country (e.g., India).
- Examination of the percentage of population infected with Covid-19 over time.
- Identification of countries with the highest infection rates concerning their population.
- Determination of countries with the highest death count per population.
- Breakdown of death count by continent.
- Analysis of global Covid-19 numbers regarding cases, deaths, and death percentages.

#### CovidVaccinations Exploration:

- Initial exploration of data fields from the CovidVaccinations table.
- Calculation of the percentage of the population that received at least one Covid vaccine.
- Usage of CTEs and Temp Tables to calculate the percentage of population vaccinated.
- Creation of a View storing data for potential future visualizations.

### Conclusion:
The analysis provided insights into the spread of Covid-19, its impact on different countries, and the progress of vaccination efforts. Key findings include:

- Identification of countries severely impacted by infections and deaths.
- Evaluation of vaccination progress across different locations.
- Understanding the relationship between Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.

### Recommendations:

- Further analysis on vaccination rates across regions for targeted intervention.
- Continuous monitoring and analysis of Covid-19 data to adapt strategies in response to the evolving situation.
